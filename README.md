# DesktopOmegle

A Desktop Application for the online chat Omegle. 

Currenlty supports just the basic feature of chatting with random strangers.

# Overview

This was written mainly as a learning excercise. I wanted to explore a little the advantages of JavaFX over Swing 
when developing Java GUI applications. There are quite a few in my opinion, but still I feel that I haven't even scratched the surface of their main differences, so a lot of work still to be done.

# Prerequisites

Written with Java 8 (JavaFX was used for the UI part). 

Built with Gradle.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Just submit a pull request detailing the changes. 

Possibilities for enhancement:

1) Write basic tests for the service module.

2) Support the feature of connecting strangers on the basis of interests.

3) Support the reCaptcha service using JavaFX webpage rendering (when Omegle supports this).
